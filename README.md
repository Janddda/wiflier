ESP8266-based Quadcopter Brain

WARNING: This project is still in its early stages!  It doesn't fly yet!

Do you think quadcopters are neat?  Eh, not really for me... BUT I THINK ESP8266's ARE AWESOME!  So, I slapped an LSM9DS1 IMU, a BMP085 barometer and an AVR co-processor with 4 PWM output drivers to a PCB small enough to fit in a hubsan X4 quadcopter.
